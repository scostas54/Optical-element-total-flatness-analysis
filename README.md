# Optical-element-total-flatness-analysis
This MATLAB program that I developed as my final project during my degree in mechanical engenieering, allows to determine the flatness of optical elements such as mirrors or reflectors. Starting from four phase distributions, it gives as a result the deviations with respect to an ideal plane for each surface.
